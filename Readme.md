# Triangles - Typescript

**Status:** ![build status](https://api.travis-ci.org/bogthe/triangles-ts.svg?branch=master)

## What?!
This is my own implementation of a [Sierpinski triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpinski_triangle) explorer using `typescript`, `karma`, `jasmine`, `tslint` and `webpack`.

## Interactive demo?
[https://bogthe.github.io/triangles-ts/](https://bogthe.github.io/triangles-ts/) 

## Set up!
- clone this repository !
- run `npm install`;
- meanwhile check `package.json` first to see the list of available scripts for linting, testing etc.;
- run `npm run webpack` before the first run ever. This will generate the bundle.js file;
- enjoy it by running `npm start`!
- code coverage will be generated when running `npm test`;

## Hack it!
Unfortunately no friendly UI is provided to mess around with the properties. *But* you can find all you need in the `context.ts` file.
