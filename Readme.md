# Triangles - Typescript
## What?!
This is my own implementation of a [Sierpinski triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpinski_triangle) explorer using `typescript`, `karma`, `jasmine`, `tslint` and `webpack`.

## Interactive demo
*Will upload it somewhere soon*. 

## Set up
- clone this repository !
- run `npm install`;
- meanwhile check `package.json` first to see the list of available scripts for linting, testing etc.;
- run `npm run webpack` before the first run ever. This will generate the bundle.js file;
- enjoy it by running `npm start`!

**Code coverage** will be generated when running `npm test`;
